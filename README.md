# DataScience

Relearning Python, SQL CTE, ML concepts and libraries, Visualisation Tools and applying statistical concepts on data. This time, through actual work.

As DBourke puts it, I have inhaled all my concepts. I have to exhale now.

Experiments

1) Heart Disease Prediction - Used Random Forests (RFC), SVM, Gradient Boosting and MLP from SKLearn to predict heart disease. MLP gave a 86.9% accuracy
