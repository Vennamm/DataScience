# DataScience

Relearning Python, SQL CTE, ML concepts and libraries, Visualisation Tools and applying statistical concepts on data. This time, through actual work.

As DBourke puts it, I have inhaled all my concepts. I have to exhale now.

Experiments

1) Heart Disease Prediction - Used Random Forests (RFC), SVM, Gradient Boosting and MLP from SKLearn to predict heart disease. MLP gave a 86.9% accuracy
2) Visualizations - Some testing visualisations I have done previously. I want to add my plotly visualisations here but they are HUGE.
3) ReferenceSpark - Just a reference file... for Spark.
4) TensorFlow Practice - Practice notes after learning Tensorflow from Coursera. Files Used - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MgbhxAEXMP8PiugIqYRWY-odT-QBDOFO?usp=sharing
5) Agent Prediction - Predicting if an applicant is capable of bringing in business.
6) Credit Card Lead - Predicting if a customer of the bank can be approached to register for a credit card
7) Racism in US - https://github.com/Vennamm/Racism-in-US
